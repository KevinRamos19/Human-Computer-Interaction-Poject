      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>

        <p>Being an irregular student and a working student at McDonald's in Rosario is no easy feat. Each day, I wake up knowing I have to juggle between my duties at work and my responsibilities as a student. It feels like a never-ending cycle—work, school, and then more work. Some days, the pressure gets too much, and I'm left feeling stressed and overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>There are moments when I find myself struggling to keep up with my assignments and activities. The constant deadlines, combined with the long hours at work, sometimes result in late submissions. It’s frustrating when I know I could’ve done better, but my time and energy are split in so many directions.</p>

        <p>But despite the setbacks, I push forward. It’s not easy, and there are days when I wonder if it’s all worth it. But when I think about my dreams and the future I want to create for myself, I know that this struggle is part of my journey. Every challenge I face, every late night, and every stressful moment is a step closer to where I want to be.</p>

        <p>It’s not always smooth sailing, but I know that I can make it. I just have to keep moving, one day at a time.</p>

      <p class="vision-goal">My dream is to build a successful life, improve my communication skills, and graduate while working to secure a better future. This vision board serves as my daily source of inspiration.</p>
